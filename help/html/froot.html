 </div>
 The goal of the game is to clear the playing field of all fruits.<br>
 <br>
 <b>"And how do I do that?</b>"<br>
You control the little launch pad at the bottom of the screen with the left
and right buttons. Use it to aim and shoot the fruit in the launch pad
upwards using the center button. If the launched fruit hits two or more fruits
of the same kind they disappear. Other fruits that were connected only to
the disappearing fruits will be knocked off.<br>
 <b><br>
 "Ok. But what's with the fancy yellow bar on the right screen edge?</b>"<br>
 The bar fills up with each fruit you shoot. If it is full the ceiling will 
move down one step and push all the fruits on the playing field with it. If
the fruits stack too far down the game is over. Knocking off some fruits will
lower the bar and thus slow down the descent of the ceiling.<br>
 <br>
 <b>"Uh. All that sounds kind of weird and complicated!"</b><br>
 If you think these instructions are complicated and confusing then just
go ahead and play the game. It's all very simple once you actually try it.<br>
<br>
<b>"Help! I can't get rid of the lemons!"</b><br>
 The lemons that show up in higher difficulty levels cannot be removed directly 
because you will never get a lemon for the launcher. Knock them off by removing 
the fruits above them instead.<br>
<br>
<b>"Is there anything else I should know?"</b><br>
